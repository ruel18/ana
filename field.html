<h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;III.	Playing Field</h3>
<br>
A.	The standard field of play is a rectangular area with dimensions as shown on the accompanying diagram (see Appendix 1).
<br><br>
B.	The playing field proper is the playing field excluding the end zones.
<br><br>
C.	The goal lines separate the playing field proper from the end zones and are part of the playing field proper.
<br><br>
D.	The playing field and surrounds should be essentially flat, free of obstructions and afford reasonable player safety. Well-trimmed grass is the recommended surface and all lines should be marked.
<br><br>
E.	The corners of the playing field proper and the end zones are marked by brightly colored, flexible cones.
<br><br>
F.	It is recommended that additional lines are established at three and five meters from the perimeter lines surrounding the playing field.
<br>
1.	Spectators and gear should remain behind the five-meter line to keep the perimeter safe and clear during play.
<br>
2.	Competitors and coaches should remain behind the three-meter line to allow play adjacent to the playing field.
<br>
<br>
G.	If play is obstructed by competitors, coaches, spectators or objects within five meters of the playing field, any obstructed player or thrower in possession may call this violation. Play resumes at the stall count reached plus one, or 9 if over 8.
